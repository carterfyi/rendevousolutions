# RWC.IQOTW Weekly Puzzle Solutions
This repo contains sample solutions to the Interview Question of The Week series in [Rendevous with Cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/). If these look like fun to you too, ([go subscribe]()) & join in the fun.

## Why?
1) I like puzzles.
2) I like the newsletter.
3) It's a cool regular thing to participate in that is good & motivating to actually write code for something personally interesting & low-stakes; in other words, it's great sport, on a schedule.
4) It feels like a good repo to make something of a project for experimentation & learning about some engineering+ subjects I'm working on getting back up to speed on after a few years away from active attention to the world of software generally & webdev in particular, such as:
    a) how does `$> git` work again?
    b) What's new in node/js/frontend-writ-large in the last 3ish years? Last time I was paying attention we were just about to reuinte the great tribes of javascript with one module spec to rule them all, where's that at?

    c) Did import maps get standardized or are we still futzing around with 27 different ways to manage telling the browser where our modules are? Have we gotten back to a world as least slightly as straightforward as `<script src="/something.js">` used to seem or is that a hopeless dream of an old man grumbling about the Next.js kids on the lawn? Speaking of Next.js
    d) Is the bundler dead, long live the bundler? Has it been abstracted into the system as a whole such that we don't think about it as such anymore, like lodash & moment basically became as a library forever? - what's going on there?
    e) Where in the "we want one tool that does everything" to "hey have you checked out this new tool? `* infinity`" neverending cycle are we?
    f) Has anyone checked that jquery still have money to keep the servers on so as to keep supporting like half the governmental digital infrastructure on earth?
    g) Is 2038 actually still gonna be a problem, or are we not gonna make it til then? Are we all stockholmed into thinking any of this was a good idea? Was IE8 really the villain or was it us after all? Was Magneto right?
    e) Language-Transcending infrastrucutre: CI/CD / Github Actions, Artifacts, Containers, Project Management
